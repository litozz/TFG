__Web Application for solving network with diverse algoritms.__

With this web app you will learn how to apply searching algorithms to diverse networks. You can draw or import/export your networks and apply the following algorithms to solve it:

* Wide search
* Deep search
* Retroactive search
* Iterative descent
* Uniform cost (Dijkstra's algorithm)
* Simple climbing
* Max slope climbing
* A*

For A\* also, you can generate non admisible heuristics that trigger the number of updates in close nodes list you want, if it's possible.
